# Contentful JS Playground

This project is a playground for [contentful.js](https://github.com/contentful/contentful.js) and [contentful-management.js](https://github.com/contentful/contentful-management.js)

It uses Webpack and loads modules through Babel, so you can use ES2015 modules if desired or just plain old ES5.

Make sure you setup your access tokens and space ids in the relevant files.

This project is not officially supported and there are no specific plans for its future.
